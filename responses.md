**1. What is the actual physical process that is allowing the Raspberry Pi to sense the environment?**  
The Raspberry Pi senses the environment by receiving electrical signals from sensors whose voltages change based on physical conditions like distance or contact. These signals are read through the GPIO pins and interpreted as digital values or timing measurements the Pi can process.

**2. What are some environmental factors that might influence the performance of these sensors?**  
Temperature, humidity, lighting, surface reflectivity, and electrical noise can alter how accurately the sensors detect inputs. Physical vibrations or obstacles can also interfere with consistent readings.

**3. What role does coding play in this process?**  
Coding tells the Raspberry Pi how to read sensor inputs, process timing or voltage changes, and interpret what those values mean. It also controls how fast the Pi checks the sensor and how it responds to the detected conditions.
