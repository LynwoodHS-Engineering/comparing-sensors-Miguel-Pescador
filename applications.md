## Applications

Limit switches, which are passive and proprioceptive sensors, help a robot detect internal contact points such as when a robotic arm reaches its movement limit. Ultrasonic sensors, which are active and exteroceptive, allow the robot to measure distance to external obstacles so it can navigate safely.

An autonomous robot can combine these sensors to avoid collisions, understand its joint limits, and move smoothly without human input. Coding enables the robot to interpret the sensor feedback and make real-time decisions so it can interact intelligently with both its internal system and its environment.
